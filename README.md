# epic-hours

This is a project to create an electronic sign to display the opening
hours in EPIC.  Basic function is simple:  display open and close time
for each day of the week.

Also, it should display the current date and time, just for fun.

For flexibility, should be able to display 4 digits:

ten hours:   (blank) or 1
one hours:   (blank) or 0-9
ten minutes: (blank) or 0, 3
one minutes: (blank) or 0

If we come up with a universal digit display (e.g. 7-segment) then
we could just use it everywhere.

A total of 28 digits plus ~10 for date/time are needed

It would be cool to have a mechanical display with electronic
controls.  Some ideas:

* 7-segment with white/black segments which toggle somehow
* flip cards like the old clocks
* rotating wheel with digits
